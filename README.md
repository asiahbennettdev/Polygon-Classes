# Polygon-Classes
Experimentation with OOP concepts to better understand and interpret classes

# Programming Language Used: 
Python

# Lesson Learned: 

Why use classes: 
1.	Safe from bugs 
  #a.	Isolate different parts of our system
  #b.	Can write Test cases for 1 class while abstracting details of other dependencies 
2.	Easy to understand 
  a.	Provides structure to code 
  b.	Can group variables and methods that share object and functionality together , and separate objects from one another 
3.	Ready from change 
  a.	Easily add new class objects to existing methods 
  b.	Or add new objects without messing up current functionality
